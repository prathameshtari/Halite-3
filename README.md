# Halite-3
Halite III is a resource management game in which players build and command ships that explore the ocean and collect halite. Ships use halite as an energy source, and the player with the most stored halite at the end of the game is the winner.

Players begin play with a shipyard, and can use collected halite to build new ships. To efficiently collect halite, players must devise a strategy based on building ships and dropoff points. Ships can explore the ocean, collect halite, and store it in the shipyard or in dropoff points. Players interact by seeking inspiring competition, or by colliding ships to send both to the bottom of the sea.
